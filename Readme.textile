h1. DCTAuth

A library for performing authorised web requests to services using OAuth, OAuth 2.0 and basic authentiaction.

h2. Documentation

DCTAuth is "fully documented":http://danieltull.co.uk/DCTAuth/documentation/ and there is a "feed for the docset":http://danieltull.co.uk/DCTAuth/documentation/docset.atom that you can add to Xcode.

h2. Known working services

While the implementations _should_ work for all services using that standard, I can confirm that they work for the following providers:

h2. Service Notes

h3. Facebook

Facebook require the callback URL to be in the format fbXXX://blah/ where XXX is your app ID.

h3. Windows Live

Microsoft have enforced that the callback URL (redirect URI) must have a scheme of HTTP or HTTPS, so to authorise with Windows Live you should set your own URL handler on the DCTAuth class to open the authorization URL in a web view inside the app. This does go against general OAuth practice, but DCTAuth allows it. Setting a callback URL with http:// as the scheme will result in working authentication to Windows Live. As far as I can tell you should use at least `wl.signin` as the scope.

h3. 37signals

37signals require a @type@ parameter to be passed into all authentication calls. To deal with this DCTAuth 3 includes @[DCTAuthAccount setParameters:forRequestType:]@ which allows you to add service specific parameters to the different requests.

To get 37signals auth working, you use the following code:

<pre>
<code>
NSURL *authorizeURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://launchpad.37signals.com/authorization/new"];
NSURL *accessTokenURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"https://launchpad.37signals.com/authorization/token"]
DCTAuthAccount *campfireAccount = [DCTAuthAccount OAuth2AccountWithType:@"Campfire"
                                                           authorizeURL:authorizeURL
                                                         accessTokenURL:accessTokenURL
                                                               clientID:@"client_id"
                                                           clientSecret:@"client_secret"
                                                                 scopes:nil];
campfireAccount.callbackURL = [NSURL URLWithString:@"callback://url"];
NSDictionary *parameters = @{ @"type" : @"web_server" };
[campfireAccount setParameters:parameters forRequestType:DCTOAuth2AccountAccessTokenRequestType];
[campfireAccount setParameters:parameters forRequestType:DCTOAuth2AccountAuthorizeRequestType];
</code>
</pre>
